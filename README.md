## Quickstart
`source <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rioda-org/idena-manager/master/install)`

`idena-manager add -p "your_private_key" -a "123"`

## Update 2020-12-12
 - Cloned repo from Crackowich
 - Trying to minimize code and enable fast sync during node instalation

## Description
This script can manage your node instances on VPS servers. Currently only Debian distributions are
  supported. Script is tested on Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 and 20.04

## Features
 - Easily add one or multiple nodes
 - Automatic update of all nodes
 - In case of node error, automatically restarts node
 - Disable or enable your node instances
 - View all the instances you have installed and their run time and status

# Instructions

We recommend to run whole script as root user, but it's not a requirement. Script will ask you for your root password
 only to install necessary dependencies.

## Install script (run this only once)
 - Go to directory you'd like to keep idena manager in (you can skip this)
 - `source <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rioda-org/idena-manager/master/install)`

## Commands
 - To add new idena node, run: `idena-manager add` (see advanced options [here](#the-add-command))
 - To view status of your nodes, run: `idena-manager status` (see detailed [here](#the-status-command))
 - To turn **off** your all nodes, run: `idena-manager disable` (see detailed [here](#the-disable-command))
 - To turn **on** your all nodes, run: `idena-manager enable` (see detailed [here](#the-enable-command))
 - Accessing help, run: `idena-manager`

# Advanced usage
Here you'll be able to find a little bit more details about each command idena-manager supports

## The *add* command
### Most used combinations
 - Fresh installation where you want everything to be decided by the script
   - Run `idena-manager add -l nodes -a "" -p ""` and the script won't ask you any questions except
  for your root
  password to install some dependencies, and only in case you already don't have another node installation on this
   server.
 - Fresh installation
   - Run `idena-manager add -l nodes -a "" -p ""`
 - Fresh installation with defined api key
   - Run `idena-manager add -l nodes -a "my_api_key" -p ""` - replace **my_api_key** with your
  key
 - Fresh installation with defined api key and private key
   - Run `idena-manager add -l nodes -a "my_api_key" -p "yourexistingnodekey"` - replace
    **my_api_key** with your key and **yourexistingnodekey** with your existing
     wallet (node) key, if you already have one. You can find it in your current installation under **datadir/keystore/nodekey**
     
### Parameters you can use (but you don't have to)
idena-manager supports multiple parameters so it could automatically do everything for you, all at once

 - `idena-manager add -l location` - replace **location** with path where you'd like to install your node instance. If
  you'd like to install to the current directory where you're at, just run `idena-manager add -l ""`. If you'd like
   to install it to sub-folder called "nodes" for example, just run `idena-manager add -l nodes`. You can enter either
    relative or absolute path.
 - `idena-manager add -a api_key` - Replace **api_key** with api key you want to use. For example: `idena-manager add
  -a "myapikey1"`. If you want the script to generate api key for you, just send empty string there: `idena-manager 
  add -a ""`. If you don't specify this parameter, script will ask you to enter your desired api key.
 - `idena-manager add -p private_key` - Replace **private_key** with your private key (key from nodekey file) if you're transferring
  your existing node to this script/server. Example: `idena-manager add -p "privatekey"`. We do not
   recommend usage of this parameter, however script does offer it. If you don't specify this parameter, script will
    ask you for your key, if you have it. If you enter `idena-manager add -p ""`, it will assume that you're doing a
     new installation and will let node to choose a key for you.
 - `idena-manager add -p port_num` - Replace **port_num** with the port you want to use. Default one is 40404. You need
  to allow this port for inbound connections on your firewall (if you're using one, and we do recommend for you to
   use it)
 - `idena-manager add -r port_num` - Replace **port_num** with your RPC port. This port is used for you to connect to
  your node from idena client

## The *status* command
 - Run: `idena-manager status` - output looks like:

## Disabling and enabling your node instances
You can temporary, or forever, disable your node instances, but you can enable them afterwards.

### The *enable* command
 - Run: `idena-manager enable num` - Replace **num** with your node instance number. First node you added is numbered
  as `1`, the second is `2`, and so on. For example, to enable your first node instance, type: `idena-manager enable 1`.
 - If you want to enable all your node instances, type: `idena-manager enable`

### The *disable* command
 - Run: `idena-manager disable num` - Replace **num** with your node instance number. First node you added is numbered
  as `1`, the second is `2`, and so on. For example, to disable your first node instance type: `idena-manager disable
   1`.
 - Please be careful because **num** parameter is not required parameter. If you run only `idena-manager disable
 `, script is going to disable all your node instances you have on that server.

## Installing dependencies
 - If you only want to install dependencies, before you start adding your nodes, you can run `idena-manager install`
